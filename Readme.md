Welcome to my **90s-inspired retro portfolio**! This single-page application (SPA) is built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and **HTML5** to showcase my skills projects and personality in a nostalgic 90s aesthetic. Dive into the retro vibes and explore my journey as a **Software Engineer** **Day Trader** and **Retro Enthusiast**.

## üìÇ How It Works

### **Routing and Content Switching**

The application handles routing and dynamically loads content based on the URL path. Each section (Home About Projects Skills Contact) is stored as a separate JavaScript file. When a link is clicked the corresponding content is injected into the main section without reloading the page.

### **Mobile Navigation**

The mobile-friendly navbar includes a collapsible hamburger menu. When clicked it toggles the visibility of the navigation links. Clicking a link closes the menu for a seamless user experience.

### **Terminal Animation**

The terminal animation simulates a command-line interface (CLI) by typing out lines of text with a delay. This effect is achieved using JavaScript's `setInterval` function.
